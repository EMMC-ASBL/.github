Shared GitHub repositories for EMMC-related projects
====================================================
The EMMC-ASBL GitHub organisation was created by EMMC for
collaboration and sharing codes between EMMC-related projects.

There is also a related GitHub organisation for [EMMO and EMMO-based
domain ontologies].

Please send an email to contact@emmc.eu if you would like to set up a

The European Materials Modelling Council (EMMC)
-----------------------------------------------
The non-profit Association, [EMMC-ASBL], was created in 2019 to
ensure continuity, growth and sustainability of EMMC activities for
all stakeholders including modellers, materials data scientists,
software owners, translators and manufacturers in Europe.  The EMMC
considers the integration of materials modelling and digitalisation
critical for more agile and sustainable product development.
